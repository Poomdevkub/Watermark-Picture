            A watermark is a recognizable text or image overlay placed on digital content,<br> 
            such as images, videos, or documents, to protect or signify ownership, authenticity,<br>  
            or copyright. Watermarks are often semi-transparent and are placed over the content <br> 
            in a way that does not obstruct its primary message but makes it harder for others to <br>
            use the content without permission.
